# monthlyExpensesWidget
Initial repository I took inspiration from: <br> 
https://github.com/Frameck/Scriptable

The script requires the Scriptable app (download <a href="https://scriptable.app">HERE</a>).

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1. The widget requires a Google Sheet file to pull data from. You can set it up by following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEoqUqm14n8&ab_channel=DeborahHo">THIS</a> tutorial.
2. Modify the script how you want it:
   - line 13: modify the currency
   - lines 30 - 43: change the months in your preferred language.
   - line 50: add your Google Sheet ID.
   - line 51: add your Google API key for retrieving data from your Google Sheet.
   - line 52: add the range of cells you have set up in your Google Sheet.
